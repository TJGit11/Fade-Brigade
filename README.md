## *Description*

A scalable, collaborative, user-focused MERN-stack single-page barbershop application. Building this project we combined a MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, an Express.js/ Node.js server with a React front end, while implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform.

**User Story:**

<code>
AS a user of The Fade Brigade Barber Shop application,

I WANT to be able to browse available barbers, book appointments for specific services, manage my profile information, and make payments securely.
</code>
